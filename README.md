This project will be an IoT security system for bikes around campus. It will be enabled by a cellular IoT module called the boron particle LTE. Additionally, the bike will have motion sensors and a circuit to detect if the lock was broken, which then will inform the user via a mobile app. Furthermore, the user will be able to locate their bike and even track their speed.
